# Monitoring-Infrastructure.

In this project, I used Systems Manager to install the CloudWatch agent on an EC2 instance. I configured it to collect both application and system metrics. I created a real-time notification that informed me when an instance was stopped or terminated. Activated AWS Config rules to ensure compliance with tagging and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

## AWS services used:
<b> **• AWS Systems Manager** - used to install CloudWatch agent on EC2 instance.</br>
<b> **• Amazon CloudWatch** - used to be monitore EC2 instance metrics.</br>
<b> **• Amazon EC2** - used to be monitored and have metrics collected.</br>
<b> **• AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** - used to store logging credentials.</br>
<b> **• Amazon Simple Notification Service(SNS)** - used to notify me when my EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.</br>
<b> **• AWS Config** - used to ensure compliance  .</br>
